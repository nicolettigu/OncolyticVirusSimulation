Note: the results of the PDE solution are stored in the folder ./< Simulations | Figures >/results with the appropriate name. I did not save the figures of all of them, only the numpy array result, to then plot and save the images with additional information using the notebook Results.ipynb (used to create the plots in the report).

SIM 1
2D random movement, pop unit = 2 for uninfected and infected too! using pop_unit != 1 for infected is not a good approximation, so this simulation is not displayed in the report.

SIM 2, 3, 4
2D random movement (delta=0.1 tau=0.2) and reference parameters

SIM 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
1D random movement (delta=0.05 tau=0.2) and reference parameters

SIM 10, 11, 12
1D pressure walk and reference parameters

SIM 13, 14
2D pressure walk and reference parameters

SIM 15
2D pressure walk Ri=Ru

SIM 16
2D pressure walk Ri=Ru, q=q/5, beta(q,p) optimal given the changed q
